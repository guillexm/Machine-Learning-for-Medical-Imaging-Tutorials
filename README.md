# Machine-Learning-for-Medical-Imaging-Tutorials
This repository contains the set of Jupyter notebook tutorials that I created for the 2022-2023 project “Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging”, as part of the Engineers without Borders Society at the University of Oxford. 

In these tutorials, we cover the basics of machine learning and biomedical imaging starting from scratch - we assume little or no prior programming experience.

They are available for anyone interested in a quick introduction to Python programming, machine learning, and biomedical imaging. If you have any comments, please feel free to contact me.
